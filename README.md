### **Project: Blockchain-Based Digital Diplomas (Graduation Certificate)**

#### **Problem**
* **Diploma Forgery:** The prevalence of fake diplomas damages trust in the education system and the job market.
* **Slow & Expensive Verification:** The manual process of verifying diplomas with universities takes days, is costly, and inefficient.
* **Vulnerable Physical Documents:** Physical diplomas are easily damaged or lost, making it difficult to prove qualifications.

Current centralized and manual solutions are highly ineffective.

---

#### **Solution**
We issue each diploma as a unique **NFT** on the Stacks blockchain. The diploma's metadata (name, major, etc.) is stored permanently and cannot be forged.

This makes verification **instant**, **secure** (forgery-proof), **efficient**, and **decentralized**, where graduates have full control over their digital credentials.

#### **Benefits**
* **For Graduates:** A secure, portable, and easily shareable digital proof of graduation.
* **For Companies:** Faster recruitment through instant and trustworthy candidate verification.
* **For Educational Institutions:** Enhances institutional integrity and drastically reduces administrative workload.
